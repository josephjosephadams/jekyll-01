Since 2015 I've been using R and Linux separately. This week I took the plunge and set up my R workflow in Ubuntu. 

Coming from the point-and-click world of Windows, it wasn't as easy as I expected. Online resources explained each part of the process reasonably well. But a big picture summary was lacking. Something to give an idea of what would be involved start to finish. Especially for someone's first time.

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img src="/assets/ubuntu-ball.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Ball" style="width: 150px;"/>
	<img src="/assets/plus-sign.jpg" alt="Plus sign" style="width: 200px;"/>
	<img src="/assets/RStudio-Ball.jpg" alt="RStudio Ball" style="width: 150px;"/>
</div>

<!-- ![RStudio Ball](/assets/RStudio-Ball.jpg)
![Ubuntu Ball](/assets/ubuntu-ball.jpg) -->

So here is my version of that big picture summary. Part 1 is a skeleton summary with all the links. Part 2 goes into some technical and psychological barriers I had to overcome.

### Part 2 - Technical and Psychological Barriers

You will find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
